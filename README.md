# F23_CSC-101
Carlow University - Fall 2023 - Programming for Everyone 
I am creating this repo a year after this course, some (a lot) of projects are most likely missing/ not all there

ROADTRIP BRANCH
  This branch includes two projects that are separate from each other
  Incorperates libraries, user input, if/else, comparison statements
  (note to self: in progForEv > PFE > pfeweek1, and these two seem to be the only other relevant ones, the others were for replit setup, 
  but you don't use that anymore. Delete those when you have the time.)
